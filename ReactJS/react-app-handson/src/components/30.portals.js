/**
 * Portals:
 *  + Portals provide a first class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the
 *    DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
 *  + NOTE: 
 *      1. When working with portals, remember that `managing keyboard focus` becomes very important.
 *      2. For modal dialogs, ensure that everyone can interact with them
 *         (by following required convention)
