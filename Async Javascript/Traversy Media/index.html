    <h2>Asyncronous Javascript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It means something is going on and you don't want to wait until that someting is completed and continue with your program</li>
        <li>It is relevant to javascript as it may take some time to get data from server but we need to do other things in the mean time.</li>
        <li>Callbacks were used for long time until ES6 arrived with promises.</li>
        <li>Async Await was introduced in ES7 which still deals with promises but in an elegant way and looks more like synchronous programming.</li>    
    </ul>
