/**
 * There are three ways to deal with asynchronous code:
 *  + Callback
 *  + Promises
 *  + Async/await
 */
/**
 * Callback:
 *  + Christmas tree indentation/Callback hell
 *  + Handling `CALLBACK HELL` by replacing one function by
 *    another is another hell.
 */
/**
 * Promises:
 *  + Inside `Promise` the function which is executed is called
 *    `executor`
 */
/**
 * Await: 
 *  + Helps us write async code in sync form
 *  + Internally made up of promises
 *  + Syntactical sugar outside with promises implementation inside
 * Async:
 *  + Without it we can't use `await`, it has to be used on the top of 
 *    a function to run `await` inside it.
