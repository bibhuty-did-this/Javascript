/**
 * Built-in validators in mongoose:
 *  + required
 *      ~ We can use required for normal or conditional validation but most
 *        importantly, during conditional validation we can't use arrow function.
 *  + minlength
 *  + maxlength
 *  + match
 *  + min
 *  + max
 *  + asynchronous validators(first put isAsync to true then write the business
 *                            logic with a callback function.)
